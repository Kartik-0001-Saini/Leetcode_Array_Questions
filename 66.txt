Question 66.) Plus One
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
        int n = digits.size();

        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            if(digits[i] < 9){
                digits[i]++;
                return digits;
            }
            digits[i] = 0;
        }

        digits.insert(digits.begin(), 1);
        return digits;
    }
};
In this i started the loop from last and add one in it if it is less than 9. And return the array.
If it is 9 than we have to put at 0 and increase the just previous digit of array. And return it.
If previous digit is not there then we have to append 1 in the array.

Time Complexity :- O(n)
Space Complexity :- O(1)
