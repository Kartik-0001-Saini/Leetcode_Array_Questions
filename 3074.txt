Question 3074.)-->  Apple Redistribution into Boxes

You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.

There are n packs where the ith pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the ith box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.

Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.

Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumBoxes(vector<int>& apple, vector<int>& cap) {
        int totAp = 0;
        for(auto i:apple){
            totAp += i;
        }
        sort(cap.begin(), cap.end(),  greater<int>());
        
        int count = 0;
        int totCap = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<cap.size(); i++){
            if(totCap < totAp){
                totCap += cap[i];
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};

In this question I have simply sort the capacity list in descending order then calculate the apples less than it capacity or not.
Then count 1 and return the result.
