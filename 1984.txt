Question 1984.) Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        if(k == 1){
            return 0;
        }
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0; i<=n-k; i++){
            minDiff = min(minDiff, nums[i+k-1] - nums[i]);
        }
        return minDiff;
    }
};
