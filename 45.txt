Question 45.)--> Jump Game II
You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at index 0.

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index (i + j) where:

0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach index n - 1. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index n - 1.

class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int nearPoint = 0, farPoint = 0, totalJump = 0;   

        while(farPoint < n-1){
            int farestPoint = 0;
            for(int i = nearPoint; i <= farPoint; i++){
                farestPoint = max(farestPoint, nums[i] + i);
            }
            nearPoint = farPoint + 1;
            farPoint = farestPoint;
            totalJump++;
        }

        return totalJump;
    }
};


In this I will take three points near, far and jump.
Jump we take to return the total number of jump we did to reach at the last.
Then we start a while where we will put the condition that farPoint is less then n - 1.
Then inside this i initialize a farest variable to track the record where we reach in the array.
Then we start with a for loop in this we initialize farest variable as max of nums[i] or farest variable itself.
then we update the value of near, far, and jump value.
At last we return the jump variable.
